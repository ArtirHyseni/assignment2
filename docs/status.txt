On branch master
Your branch and 'origin/master' have diverged,
and have 1 and 1 different commits each, respectively.
  (use "git pull" to merge the remote branch into yours)

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   .DS_Store
	new file:   docs/status.txt

I had to rever one commit to get the correct output
